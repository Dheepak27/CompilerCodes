This repository contains C implementations of various fundamental compiler design concepts, useful for academic understanding and demonstrations.

- Lexical Analyzer (with and without space as a delimiter)
- Left Recursion Elimination
- Left Factoring
- First and Follow Set Computation
- Leading and Trailing of Grammar
- Shift-Reduce Parser
- Three Address Code (TAC) Generation
- Shift-Reduce Parser with TAC Generation during Reduce Actions
- Predictive Parser with Parsing Table

All programs were manually implemented for academic learning purposes and are **not copied from online sources**. As a result, they may not work correctly for all test cases or handle all edge cases. These implementations are intended for conceptual understanding rather than production use.

Each concept is implemented in a separate C file. You can compile and run them individually using a C compiler like `gcc`.
